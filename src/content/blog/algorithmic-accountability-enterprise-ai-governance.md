lead: Most enterprise AI governance treats large language models like traditional software. But while software is machinery, an LLM environment is weather. Its behavior emerges from a constantly shifting mix of data, permissions, workflows, and updates—meaning a system can materially change while the product name stays exactly the same. Managing this new reality requires an entirely new approach to algorithmic accountability.

Enterprise AI accountability does not belong exclusively to law, business, technology, HR, audit, or risk. It exists in the space between them.

That may sound like a modest observation, but it is not. It helps explain why **[enterprise AI governance](/disclosure-independent-governance/)** keeps failing at organizations that have already deployed these systems, and why the parties studying them often see only fragments of the problem. That fragmentation starts with a basic category error: most organizations are still governing enterprise AI as though it were conventional software.

## Treating AI Like Software Undermines AI Governance

Most enterprise AI governance still treats large language models the way organizations have traditionally treated software: as products to be procured, configured, secured, and monitored for defects. That instinct is understandable, but it is also incomplete, because the underlying object being governed does not behave like a product at all.

> Software performs functions. An LLM can participate in an evolving cognitive process around a human goal.

**Traditional software is machinery. An LLM environment is weather.** A machine remains substantially stable until someone modifies it: change the code and the behavior changes, but leave it alone and it generally performs the same operation tomorrow that it performed today. An LLM environment does not hold still in the same way, since its behavior emerges from the ongoing interaction of the model, the retrieval systems feeding it, the enterprise data around it, user permissions, system configurations, surrounding workflows, individual prompts, provider-side updates, and simple time.

As a result, an organization can keep using the same product name and the same license while the operating conditions surrounding the system change underneath it. No single internal modification or approval event is required for that shift to happen.

Retrieved sources may change. Permissions may expand. The provider may update the model with limited visibility to the enterprise. Employees may gradually begin using the system for decisions it was never originally approved to influence.

Governing this kind of environment as though it were a fixed executable product is the foundational mistake, and many of the accountability failures now appearing downstream follow directly from this mistake.

## Enterprise AI Accountability Failures Across Law, Business, and HR

The evidence is no longer hypothetical. Fabricated legal authorities have entered court filings. Unreliable or invented clinical information has required expert intervention before reaching patients.

Automated employment tools have generated discrimination and explainability disputes, while employer-mandated AI use has quietly transferred verification and correction work onto the employees using it. Insurance carriers, meanwhile, are beginning to respond through underwriting scrutiny, AI exclusions, affirmative AI coverage, and technical risk assessment, effectively turning governance evidence into an insurability question. And board oversight obligations are forming around systems that directors may not fully see or understand.

These should not be treated as unrelated AI incidents to be filed away in separate departmental folders. They are, instead, manifestations of the same underlying accountability problem, simply appearing in different institutional settings depending on where the system happens to touch consequential work.

Across every case, the same five questions determine what actually happened:

- Who relied on the system?
- Who was qualified to recognize that its output was unreliable?
- Who had the authority to approve, reject, or escalate the result?
- What evidence was preserved?
- Whose professional judgment, employment status, legal duty, or corporate authority ultimately carried the decision?

None of that can be resolved through technical performance metrics alone. It requires exactly the kind of cross-disciplinary judgment that existing institutions were never built to exercise together.

## Law & Business: Two Parts of AI Governance

A law school tends to see professional responsibility, evidence, liability, discrimination, and contractual duty. A business school tends to see implementation, productivity, internal controls, workforce capacity, investment return, and operating risk. Technology teams, for their part, tend to see model performance, system architecture, access controls, and security. Each discipline is seeing something real, but none of them is seeing the whole enterprise problem, because the complete question sits between them — the same five questions above, none of which any single department owns.

Answering that question well requires holding several forms of analysis together at once, rather than choosing one and setting the others aside. [The Name Standard℠,](/blog/the-name-standard-ai-governance/) for instance, addresses traceable human attribution in AI-assisted decisions, while **[the Power User Trap℠](/frameworks/power-user-trap/)** identifies the hidden verification burden absorbed by employees whose expertise is what keeps unreliable output from reaching the organization.

Caremark-style oversight questions, in turn, concern what boards and senior leaders are expected to know about consequential systems operating inside the enterprise, and insurance exclusions, affirmative coverage, and underwriting requirements determine whether the organization's transfer of risk truly corresponds to its real AI practices. System drift complicates the issue further because it calls into question whether a previously approved deployment, remains meaningfully the same deployment. 

Taken together, these address different links in the same accountability chain: authority, review capacity, oversight, risk transfer, system change, and proof. They are usually divided among separate professional disciplines, but in practice they describe one terrain. Nowhere is that more visible than in the concept of drift.

## Eight Types of Enterprise AI Drift

The word *drift* is often used as though it describes a single technical event: changes in model inputs, performance, or expected outcomes over time. In an enterprise setting, AI drift is broader than that. It includes at least eight forms that materially affect governance.

That definition matters because the operating environment experienced by an employee is never the model alone. It is the combined effect of the model, the retrieval environment, the enterprise data, permissions, configuration, workflow, human behavior, and time. Each of those elements can change independently, and together they determine what the system can see, how it interprets a request, which information it retrieves, what answer it produces, how employees rely on it, and what evidence remains afterward.

This is not simply a list of technical failure modes; it is a demonstration of why algorithmic accountability cannot be assigned to one existing department or academic discipline.

### Content drift

Approved language changes during AI-assisted design, development, formatting, or implementation, causing the published content to diverge from the authoritative source without a deliberate editorial decision.

### Model drift

Model drift is partly a technical and vendor-governance problem. It occurs when a provider changes the underlying model, routing, safety behavior, system instructions, or generation architecture, often with limited visibility to the enterprise relying on it.

### Retrieval drift

Retrieval drift, by contrast, is a data-governance and information-integrity problem. It arises when indexes, embeddings, ranking systems, connectors, source documents, or chunking methods change what the system can find, which means the same question can yield a different answer for reasons that have nothing to do with the model itself.

### Permission drift

Permission drift is an identity, access-control, privacy, and internal-control problem. It occurs when changing access rights alter which enterprise information the system can retrieve for a given user, so that two employees asking the same question may effectively be operating two different systems.

### Context drift

Context drift is a more evidentiary and operational problem. It arises as email, meetings, documents, prior interactions, and current work conditions change the information surrounding a request, shifting what the system treats as relevant without anyone deciding that it should.

### Workflow drift

Workflow drift is a management and professional-responsibility problem. Employees gradually expand a system's role, so that a tool approved for drafting becomes a research tool, a recommendation engine, an analytical assistant, or an informal decision-maker, all without a corresponding approval event ever taking place.

### Economic drift

Economic drift is a finance and workforce-capacity problem. It occurs when token costs, cloud charges, verification labor, correction time, and review requirements move away from the assumptions in the original business case, quietly eroding the return the deployment was approved on.

### Evidence drift

Evidence drift is a legal, audit, and litigation-readiness problem, and it is the most consequential of the eight. Even where logs exist, the surviving record may no longer be sufficient to reproduce why a particular output occurred — a company may be able to show who used a system, when, and what response appeared, while remaining unable to show why that response was selected, what was omitted, or whether an upgrade changed the answer. That gap only widens as logs expire, models change, records are edited, source documents disappear, and employees leave.

## No Single Discipline Can Govern All 8 Forms of Drift

No single discipline is positioned to govern all eight forms of drift on its own, because each one crosses a different institutional boundary. **Technology can monitor model behavior,** but it may not be positioned to determine whether a changed workflow requires renewed legal approval. **Legal can identify liability** once a flawed output causes harm, but it typically has no visibility into whether a retrieval-side change — a new index, a swapped connector, a different ranking method — is what produced that output in the first place.

**Finance can detect cost variance,** but it may not see the hidden review labor that is keeping the system usable. Audit can test controls, but it may not be able to reproduce the operating environment that produced a challenged decision. And **HR can see workforce effects**, but it typically does not control the model, the permissions, the vendor contract, or the evidence-retention architecture behind them.

The drift taxonomy is therefore itself evidence of the institutional problem. The object being governed is not one model or one software product; it is a changing enterprise environment in which technical systems, professional judgment, legal duties, financial assumptions, workforce capacity, and organizational authority all interact.

That creates a central governance problem: logging does not guarantee reproducibility. An organization may know who used a system, what prompt was entered, and what response appeared, and still be unable to recreate why that answer was produced, which sources were considered, which were omitted, what system route was followed, or whether the same operating conditions even still exist.

The relevant control question, then, is not simply whether the system is being monitored. It is what organizational control should follow when the AI environment has materially changed, even though the product name and license remain the same.

In practice, the evidence behind an AI-assisted decision tends to fall into one of four categories:

- **Reproducible** — the interaction and material operating conditions can be recreated with reasonable confidence.
- **Traceable** — the user, prompt, response, and principal resources can be identified, but the result cannot be recreated.
- **Attributable only** — a person or business process can be connected to the output, but the underlying system evidence is incomplete.
- **Unrecoverable** — the organization cannot reliably determine what happened or what influenced the result.

Which category a given decision falls into is rarely known in advance. It is usually discovered only once someone needs the evidence and finds out whether it still exists.

## AI Governance Retrofit for Enterprise AI

This is the part that matters most commercially, because most enterprises have already deployed these systems. Already deployed, however, does not mean ungovernable; it means governance must be reconstructed around a live system rather than designed into a new one.

That reconstruction requires answering questions many organizations never asked at the time of deployment:

- Where is AI already operating, and which decisions and professional outputs does it influence?
- What controls were assumed to exist but never tested?
- Who is performing the review and correction work that keeps the output usable, and do senior leaders know that labor exists?
- Do the people responsible for review have the expertise, time, information, authority, and right of refusal necessary to challenge the system?
- What changes in models, permissions, data, configuration, or use should trigger a renewed approval?
- If a dispute, audit, insurance claim, or regulatory inquiry arrives next year, can the organization reconstruct what happened well enough to defend the decision?

The retrofit is harder and more awkward than building governance into a deployment from the beginning, since cost, ambiguity, reliance, hidden labor, and evidence loss may already have accumulated, and governance cannot erase what has already occurred. But harder does not mean impossible. 

## Why Algorithmic Accountability Needs An Interdisciplinary Methodology

These topics and questions in this article point toward the need for an interdisciplinary field of teaching, research, and practice situated between law and business, built around the governance of AI systems already operating across institutions. Its purpose would not be another broad discussion of AI ethics, nor a technical laboratory focused primarily on model development. It would instead take up the questions that fall between existing departments:

- Human attribution
- Professional reliance
- Evidence preservation
- Internal control
- Workforce burden
- Organizational authority
- Legal and contractual exposure
- Post-deployment monitoring
- Material system change
- Accountability retrofit

The methodology could combine teaching, applied research, case analysis, executive education, and governance tools, examining live legislation, litigation, insurance practices, board oversight, enterprise deployment, and post-deployment evidence failures not as separate subjects but as parts of one accountability system. Law and business students will encounter these problems from different professional positions, often while advising the same organization: one evaluating liability, discrimination, evidentiary sufficiency, or professional responsibility, the other assessing implementation, cost, productivity, controls, or operational risk. Neither can understand the problem fully without understanding the other.

This is the territory [Lozen Advisory's executive AI governance curriculum](https://www.executiveaiskills.com/) was built to address: not simply how organizations adopt AI, but how they preserve human accountability when probabilistic systems enter consequential work. The failures are already moving between departments, from the courtroom to the boardroom, from HR to finance, from professional practice to the insurer's fine print. The teaching, research, and governance structures designed to address them must move the same way.

**Algorithmic accountability needs a room of its own.**
